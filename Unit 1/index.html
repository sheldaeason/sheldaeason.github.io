	<h1>Verizon's In-House Brand Creative Team</h1>
	<p>Today Verizon followed Sprint, Chipotle, Coca-Cola, Facebook and more in establishing its own in-house creative advertising agency.

The telecom giant, which is currently one of the five biggest ad buyers in the U.S., hired global group creative director Andrew McKechnie away from Apple to run the new department. The chief creative officer will work out of corporate headquarters in lower Manhattan, collaborating with a team of staffers who had been working across the Verizon organization and reporting directly to CMO Diego Scotti.</p>
